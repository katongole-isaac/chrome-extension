# ðŸš€ Chrome Extension Development Template Setup

Effortless Chrome Extension Development â€” This template streamlines building Chrome extensions with `React`, `TypeScript`, `Vite`, and `Tailwind CSS`, using a JavaScript-format `manifest.json` for full flexibility.

## Directory Structure

`manifest.config.ts` â€“ This TypeScript file defines the configuration for your Chrome extension and is used to generate the `manifest.json` file.

`index.html` â€“ Serves as the default_popup for the extension, configured under the `action` field in the `manifest.config.ts`.

`public/` â€“ Contains static assets that are copied directly into the final build. These files can be referenced in your extension without import.

`public/images` â€“ Contains various icons used by the extension, such as for the toolbar, context menus, or the Chrome Web Store listing.

`src/` â€“ Contains all the source code for the extension, including scripts, styles, and React components.


`src/scripts` â€“ Contains the `content-scripts` used in the extension's [content-scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/content-scripts "Content Scripts"). 

`src/scripts/content.tsx` â€“ This file serves as a content script and is referenced in the `content_scripts` section of `manifest.config.ts`.

`src/scripts/app.tsx` â€“ Contains the default React component rendered by `src/scripts/content.tsx`. If you're not using React, you can remove this and instead configure the script path in the `content_scripts` section of `manifest.config.ts`.

`src/service-worker` â€“ Contains the service worker scripts that handle background tasks for the Chrome extension, such as event listeners and message passing.

`src/service-worker/background.ts` â€“ The entry point script for the Chrome extensionâ€™s service worker, also included in the `service_worker` section of `manifest.config.ts`.

`src/main.tsx` â€“ The default React entry point file used for rendering the popup UI (`popup.html`).

`src/app.tsx` â€“ Contains the default React component for the popup, which is imported and rendered by `src/main.tsx`.

`src/style.css` â€“ Contains Tailwind CSS styles used for styling the popup UI and other extension components.
